Naarayanaaya Namo | Gajendra Moksha | Padya 1

In the ancient land of Pandya Desha, there lived a noble and devout king named Indradyumna. Renowned for his vast kingdom and spiritual inclinations, he often meditated on Lord Vishnu, seeking peace and transcendence. Despite his spiritual pursuits, Indradyumna once failed in a fundamental duty: hospitality.

One day, venerable sages like Sanaka and Agastya, accompanied by their disciples, visited his palace. Engrossed in his meditations, Indradyumna neglected to welcome them appropriately. This lack of courtesy deeply displeased the wise Agastya. In his righteous anger, the sage pronounced a curse: "O King! Your pride in your spiritual knowledge blinds you to the simplest virtues. You shall be reborn as an elephant, a symbol of strength but devoid of wisdom."

Bound by the sage’s words, Indradyumna was reborn as Gajendra, a majestic elephant. In his new life, Gajendra became the ruler of a vast jungle, admired for his immense strength, beauty, and charisma. He was the undisputed leader of his herd, and countless animals thrived under his protection.

One summer, during a sweltering day, Gajendra led his family to a lush, enchanting part of the jungle. The area brimmed with natural beauty: cascading waterfalls, fragrant flowers, and abundant fruit trees. The herd rejoiced, playing and bathing in the cool waters. Gajendra, surrounded by his wives and children, was immersed in sheer bliss, relishing the moment of carefree happiness.

Suddenly, an unexpected tragedy struck. From the depths of the serene waters, a massive crocodile emerged. Its jaws clamped tightly around Gajendra’s leg, pulling him with ferocious force. Shocked but undeterred, Gajendra fought back with all his might. His family and herd rallied around him, trying to rescue their leader. However, the crocodile’s grip was unyielding, and its strength matched Gajendra’s.

What ensued was a battle of endurance. Both the elephant and the crocodile fought fiercely, their struggle stretching over thousands of years. As the years passed, Gajendra’s strength waned. Blood from his wounds turned the water red, and his once-loyal herd, powerless and disheartened, began to abandon him one by one.

For the first time in his life, Gajendra faced utter helplessness. His invincible strength, his pride, and the support of his loved ones—all were rendered meaningless. Alone and despairing, Gajendra experienced a profound realization. His earthly power and relationships had failed him, but there was one eternal refuge he had forgotten: Lord Vishnu.

Drawing from the spiritual wisdom of his past life, Gajendra surrendered himself completely. With folded trunk and unwavering faith, he plucked a lotus flower from the water and offered it to the heavens. Chanting a heartfelt prayer, he called out to the Supreme Being:

"O Lord of the Universe, the eternal protector of the helpless! I surrender to You. Free me from this suffering, for none but You can rescue me."

Gajendra’s prayer echoed through the cosmos, reaching the divine abode of Lord Vishnu. Moved by the sincerity and devotion in Gajendra’s plea, Vishnu mounted his celestial eagle, Garuda, and descended to the earthly realm.

As the Lord arrived, the waters of the lake shimmered with divine light. Wielding his Sudarshana Chakra, Vishnu swiftly severed the crocodile’s grip, liberating Gajendra. The crocodile, revealed to be a Gandharva cursed to this form, was also freed from his curse and attained salvation.

Humbled and overwhelmed, Gajendra prostrated before Vishnu. The Lord, pleased with Gajendra’s surrender and devotion, blessed him with moksha—the liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Gajendra’s soul ascended to the eternal Vaikuntha, united forever with the Supreme Being.

==============================================

There ruled a king named Indradyumna in Pandya desha. The one who was the owner of great landmass. He meditated the lord to overcome distress. There visited great rishis like sanaka and agastya along with their desciples. The king indradyumna didnt provide hospitality to his ghuests. The unpleased wise man cursed him to take birth as an animal(elephant).
This elephant known as gajendra, was very attractive charming, strong and undefeated male elephant. All the little animals in the jungle always surrounded him and felt safe arround him. One hot summer day the group of elephants which is the whole family of gajendra when to a beatiful part of jungle that consisted of waterfall, sented flowers and fruits etc. Gajendra played joyfully with his kids and wifes and was completely lost in happiness.
At this movement a huge evil crocodile in the water strongly caught the leg of gajendra and didnt leave him. Even gajendra and all of his friends tried to escape but crocodile didnt leave the leg of gajendra. Both being equally strong no on could help them, they both fought for thousands of years but no one got defeated. At this time gajendra who had never faced defeat in his entire life was now fainting, his blood drowned in the water and no one from his family stayed before him for help. He had spend his entire life in protection and nurturing of his loved ones but no one showed up now. Gajendra realised it the shri hari alone who can secure him and protect him so he starts praying the god.
